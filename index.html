    <h1>Claim</h1>
      <p>Inside the mystery black box, there is some sort of tubing used for the water to travel from the input funnel to the output tube. </p>
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
      <p>The mystery black box is a closed box, with a funnel at the top and a tube at the bottom, that outputs arbitrary amounts of water for some amount of input water, such as inputting 500 ml and outputting 0 ml. <br></br> Some of the initial observations I made were that the first time water was inputted, there was no output of water. Along with this observation, I used my senses to notice that there was no sound of water dripping against any materials and that the water inputted into the funnel was going through the funnel slowly and not at once.<br></br> Using these observations, I combined any prior knowledge of other machines to find similarities and differences so I could start creating an idea of what could be inside the black box.<br></br> After creating the model, my group and I tested it by pouring in a measured amount of input water and recording what the output water was.<br></br>In our model, a key structure was the tubing inside. This tubing could be one of the main reasons there was no sound and why the water went down the funnel so slowly.<br></br>One of the most important things in our data was that our very first trial was by inputting 500 ml of water and getting an output of 0 ml. This is very similar to what happened with the actual mystery black box. </p>
