    <h1>Claim</h1>
       <p>Inside the mystery black box, there is some sort of tubing used for the water to travel from the input funnel to the output tube. </p>
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
       <p>The mystery black box is a closed box, with a funnel at the top and a tube at the bottom, that outputs arbitrary amounts of water for some amount of input water, such as inputting 500 ml and outputting 0 ml. <br></br> Some of the initial observations I made were that the first time water was inputted, there was no output of water. Along with this observation, I used my senses to notice that there was no sound of water dripping against any materials and that the water inputted into the funnel was going through the funnel slowly and not at once.<br></br> Using these observations, I combined any prior knowledge of other machines to find similarities and differences so I could start creating an idea of what could be inside the black box.<br></br> After creating the model, my group and I tested it by pouring in a measured amount of input water and recording what the output water was.<br></br>In our model, a key structure was the tubing inside. This tubing could be one of the main reasons there was no sound and why the water went down the funnel so slowly.<br></br>One of the most important things in our data was that our very first trial was by inputting 500 ml of water and getting an output of 0 ml. This is very similar to what happened with the actual mystery black box. </p>
    <h3>Reasoning, Part I</h3>
       <p>Models are smaller and simpler visual representations of more complex and possibly virtual designs. They are a simple way to see what a design looks and a good way to use human senses, such as touch and sound, to understand the design more. However, models have limitations as well. They are not always as accurate or precise as the actual design and many times there are differences between the model and design that could affect the outcome. Because of human error, it is difficult to replicate a design exactly. </p>
    <h4>Reasoning, Part II</h4>
        <p>Our claim on what is inside the mystery black box can be proven true by our observations and evidence. Our second observation on the water going down the funnel slowly was objective and because there was no sound of water hitting a box, there has to be some tubing that allows the water to travel inside.<br></br> While testing our model of the mystery black box, we used small and clear tubing to ensure that the water would go down the funnel slowly and there would be no sound audible from the water falling. Our data from testing is also similar to the first few tests done on the mystery black box, with no water coming out on the first trial and different outputs of water coming out with a constant input of water.<br></br>These similarities are factual and objective, therefore proving our claim true.</p>
    <h5>Reasoning, Part III</h5>
        <p>Inside the mystery black box, there is no tubing used for the water to travel from the input funnel to the output tube.<br></br>If this claim were true, we would hear the water traveling throughout the inside of the black box, as well as seeing that the water was leaving the funnel quickly. If we had timed how long it took for the water to output in the black box and our model, there would certainly be a difference because the water would not have the resistance of the tubeâ€™s small diameter stopping it from traveling quickly. In our model, however, these outcomes were not observed. There were no signs of water leaving the funnel as soon as it was poured or any audible noise of the water traveling. This is another reason for why our real claim is true.</p>
